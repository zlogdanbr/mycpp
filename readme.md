template_lib
===============

A large header file with the usefull code I wrote or found on books, internet or forums. ( The sources are always mentioned when applicable ). 
It is a large header file with a few namespaces. Contains useful code for search, debug, file, buffer handling etc


The usage is simple. Copy the util.h header file to your project and include it.

IMPORTANT:
I use STL and C++17

It contains the following nested namespaces
>namespace mytools::algo
Contains code to be used with STL, DS and algorithms

>namespace mytools::util
Contains useful code not buffer/string related

>namespace mytools::buffer_handlers
Contains useful code buffer/string related

>namespace mytools::mymath
Contains matrix, linear algebra, interpolation

OBS: Pending some description of other namespaces.

It also includes examples of their usage at the subfolder demo.
